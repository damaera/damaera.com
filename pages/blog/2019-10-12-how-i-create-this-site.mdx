# How I create this site

When I resign from Bukalapak, I must prepare myself for some interviews.
I create a brand new CV and then saw my old website. It looks like this.

<img src="/static/blog/old-damaera-com.png" style={{ width: "100%" }} />

The design is still good, but outdated.
The layout was a bit mainstream with the big hero image at the center of attention.
The image is a wolf, (i imagine it direwolf of house stark, the King of the north).
Because the web layout is outdated and Game of Thrones is already ended (with the unsatisfying ending),
i need to rebuild my site. from scratch.

## What I want

- React

## What I (really) need

I created this website using Next.js, MDX.
